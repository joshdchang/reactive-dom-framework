# Reactivity framework experiment

This repo is a reactive DOM framework that I made as an experiment and for fun. It uses signals to manage reactivity in a way that is very fine-grained, so it's quite performant. The part that I think is unique is that it provides a reasonable approach to building components entirely in JavaScript (aka not JSX) while still being declarative (not class-based). It's a little wonky, but I also think it's kinda cool.
